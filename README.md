## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I'm able to get the program to read the messages from the url, but I'm unable to get the messages to append. If I isolate the code and just display the messages, I'm able to get them to display. But I'm unable to get them to display in the chatbox and edit. When I run a function individually such as the update, or the read messages, It seems to be working, I encounter issues when I put all the functions together and when I try to submit messages. I tried searching around and editing code to get them working, but I was unable to find the exact cause.
### How long it took me to finish this?

1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
